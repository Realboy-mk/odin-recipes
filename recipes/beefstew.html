            <p><h2>Slow cooked meal to warm you up in the winter</h2></p>
                <p>My mother would make one of the most basic, yet delicious beef stews this side of the Mississippi.
                    Which side of the Mississippi?  Either side, that beef stew was killer!  It's a simple recipe.  Make 
                    sure you scrape up the brown bits after browning the beef.  The wine will help to deglaze the pan of 
                    those bits, to scrapping them while adding the wine is a good time.

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine flour, garlic powder and salt & pepper. Toss beef in flour mixture.</li>
                        <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot. Cook the beef and onions until browned.</li>
                        <li>Add beef broth and red wine while scraping up any brown bits in the pan.</li>
                        <li>Stir in all remaining ingredients except for peas, cornstarch and water. 
                            Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer 1 hour or until beef is tender (up to 90 minutes).</li>
                        <li>Mix equal parts cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the 
                            boiling stew to reach desired consistency (you may not need all of the slurry, 
                            if you'd like a thicker stew, you can add extra).</li>
                        <li>Stir in peas and simmer 5-10 minutes before serving . Season with salt & pepper to taste.</li>
                    </ol>
